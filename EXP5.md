# EXPERIMENT- CURRENT MIRROR 
## AIM 
Design and Analyze Current mirror circuit as active load in amplifier circuit.
Given : Vdd=1.8V, P<=1 mW, Av>-10 V/V.
## COMPONENTS REQUIRED
MOSFETS-nmos pmos , conneccting wire, current source, power supply
## THEORY 

A current mirror is a circuit that copies (mirrors) the current from one branch to another. It uses two matched transistors  MOSFETs to ensure the same current flows in both branches.

a)Depends on gate-source voltage Vgs matching 

b)M1 is diode connected forcing Vgs1=Vgs2

c)If both MOSFETs have same size and threshold voltage,Iout=Iref.

### Applications 

Biasing circuits -providing stable currents in amplifiers.

Active loads -replacing resistors in ICs for better performance.

Current sources -delivering fixed current to other parts of a circuit.
